# Spiking dentate gyrus
Code for Masters thesis about a spiking restricted Boltzmann Machine model of the dentate gyrus to investigate the influence of neurogenesis on pattern separation. 

At the moment most of the code is directly copied from: https://github.com/eneftci/eCD 
It has been adapted in part by me to work in python 3 with brian 2

brian version: brian2 2.5.1
